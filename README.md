## Experiment with Attention Mechanisms

| Attentions | Training Loss | Traning PPL | Validation Loss | Validation PPL |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|General Attention    | 3.815     | 45.379     | 4.111     | 61.010     |
| Multiplicative Attention   | 3.383     | 29.473     | 3.942     | 51.510     |
| Additive Attention  | 2.987     | 19.835     | 3.849     | 46.941     |

This experiment was conducted with RNN /GRU + Attention
